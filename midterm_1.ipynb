    "Write a function called `calculateEmpiricalPobs` that takes the container that is returned by the function `recordDiceThrows`, calculates the empirical probability of a total, and returns a list of tuples containing this information for each total between 2 and 12, including zero counts. Note that all the probabilities should sum up to 1 (not taking rounding up errors into account).\n",

    "* The total probabilities are \n",

    "    * **Important Warning:** This format is not a hint for part 1. It may not be even the best choice to represent this. We are specifying this to make grading easier. "
